Answer 1 : In the provided diagram, the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship defined by the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This "category_id" column is an integer type that refers to the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This indicates that a many products is associated with one product category, while a product category can have multiple products associated with it. Thus, This creating a many-to-one relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category".

Answer 2 : To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you could implement a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This would ensure that any attempt to insert a new product into the "Product" table with an invalid "category_id" (i.e., an "id" that does not exist in the "Product_Category" table) would result in an error. Also, we could use database triggers or application-level validation to ensure that updates to the "category_id" column in the "Product" table maintain the referential integrity between the two tables.
